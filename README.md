# wara_arduino_talk_10_28_2015
This is the keynote and image assets I used during my Arduino for Hams lecture and demonstration at the Waltham Amateur Radio Association club meeting Wed. October 28th, 2015. I talked about embedded systems and showed a handful of Arduino projects directed at HAMs getting started in that space.
